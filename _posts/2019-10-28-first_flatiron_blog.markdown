My first project for Flatiron is complete!

I must say it was fun, sometimes stressful, but overall enjoyed it. Was especially excited as I had to switch cohorts due to added stress from work. But now, after leaving my past job, I am able to dedicate more time to Flatiron, and being able to make it past Project 1, I am finally ahead of where I was before.


**Project 1 Details**

We were giving a dataset on house prices in King County, Washington. From here, we were to view what features would be most important for our target audience. I, and probably 90% of Flatiron, viewed it as if we are presenting this data to potential flippers to understand what they should do to a home to boost up the prices. Okay! Seems simple, then after taking out null values, I was there confused wondering what to do now?!?!!?!

I am not used to open-ended projects. Was use to the Learn curriculum, where they told us how to manipulate data and they told us exactly what to do, but now I was lost.lol. After a talk with my Cohort Lead James, I realized I could drop data if it made sense for what I was trying to do. So thinking about the few Home Flipping shows I watched growing up (ok more like a million of them. I was a teenager during the major housing bubble so there were so many of those shows lol), I realized a first-time flipper is gonna need to work with a home he/she can realistically handle. Homes with more than 10 bedrooms? DROPPED! Homes over 3500 sq ft? DROPPED! Homes with lot sizes over half-acre? DROPPED! Yea, my fears of dropping.....well.....dropped. My table was smaller, and my skews as visualized in histograms were sexier:
